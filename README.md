# How to run the game for the first time!
Read the entire readme.
Download python installer(3.x) from python.org based on your system architecture(x86/x64(AMD). We recommend the installation of x86 version as installing pygame module is not very easy in some computers running x64 python interpreters). Add python to path if you are executing the file in an IDE.
Install python with pip and add it environment variables, in the options while installing.
Check for the version of pip installed in your computer by using the command -  python -m pip --version. The latest version of pip as of November 2018 is 18.1 If you do not have this version, connect to the internet and type python -m pip install --upgrade pip in command prompt and wait for it to install completely. If this doesnâ€™t work, copy paste the text in this file in a notepad and save as a .py file. Run this file in the command prompt and pip gets automatically updated.
Look at the requirements file, install any module in that if you don't have it. This project explicitly requires the following modules which are not provided with the standard installation - pygame and pillow. However you can install these by connecting to the internet typing the following in the command prompt -  python -m pip install pygame and  python -m pip install pil 
Download the Latest version of the project available and apply replace relevent files from the patches directory, although they should be already applied to the latest release.

The game is known to produce a black screen and freeze sometimes while running, don't worry. Close the window in this case and try until it succeeds.
Create and account, login, Play and Enjoy!

P.S. //We hate windows for the hideous backslash path names
